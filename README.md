AndroidServerInteraction
========================

Example of interaction between application and site, using JSON

First of all, you need to import android project to your workspace. Then put the folder "android_connect" to your server. And in the file "db_config.php" you can configure your database preferences. In your server in MySQL you should create database named "androidhive" as you see in "db_config.php" file. Or you can change it right there. Then create tables with appropriate columns looking to source files. Then you can run android project on emulator(or on phone, wherever you want), and test how it works.
